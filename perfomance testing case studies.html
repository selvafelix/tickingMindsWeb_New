Around a million devices were expected to be enrolled into this solution globally, and they all will be connected to the digital asset management solution servers distributed over the globe. Overall, the entire performance testing exercise helped in addressing the various bottlenecks thereby increasing the devices per server from an initial level of 300 devices to 950 devices by the time the solution was rolled out. Brought down the overall cost of ownership of the solution for the customer, by helping him to increase the number of devices / server. This results in a direct $ benefit of more than $ 400 Mill per year for the client, when 1 Million devices are on-board.</p><a class="link" href="Performance_Case Study1.html">Read More</a>

                                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The client had been using a secondary sales application for supply chain distribution management. Different distributors and business development team of the client about 300 users  use this application to manage their stock specific information mainly, among other things. User base was expected to triple in about 3 years’ timeframe. Post fix of performance issues and implementation of recommendations, it was able to handle 1000 concurrent users from original 50 users. Application performance improvements brought about with lesser spend from client side across infrastructure, moving complex resource intensive computations from application server side to the database side. High level of assurance to the client on application stability and scalability, which gave stronger confidence to the client for swift and larger roll out.</p><a class="link" href="Performance_Case Study2.html">Read More</a>

Client had done a technology upgrade to the product and wanted to benchmark the new platform with the existing system. Load tests unearthed 8 key performance issues across db and app server layers, brought out distinct insights to performance improvements in areas of search operations and imaging operations. Performance improvements helped meet < 8 seconds SLA, which in turn provided an assurance for customer satisfaction. Recommendations were provided on the server capacity sizing, to leverage optimal resource usages, which was acknowledged by architect and infrastructure teams.</p><a class="link" href="Performance_Case Study3.html">Read More</a>

Owing to the various performance issues, Oracle recommended them to upgrade to Siebel 8.1. However, before they rolled out to production, they realised that the performance issues were still prevalent in v8.1 as well. Realistic load simulation were carried out using NeoLoad tool with load injection from  Cambridge USA, Krakow Poland and Bangalore India. Key performance issues were unearthed largely in the database layer, where indexing recommendations brought-in significant 30% improvement in response times.  No tool other than Neotys has great monitoring capability for the Siebel platform, which had provided about 50% effort saving in monitoring and resolution.</p><a class="link" href="Performance_Case Study4.html">Read More</a>

Worked closely with platform SMEs, to understand the way the business operates, identify list of end of end business critical transactions, business usage patterns in order to develop a workload model to simulate real-life load on the system. Need for having multiple workloads were identified factoring for high usage during scholarship notifications, college admissions, bank promos. Cloud based setup was first measured for single instance setup, with performance bottlenecks like missing indexes, time consuming ineffective SQL queries. Improvements were made to support 1200+ concurrent users spanning across applicants, banks, approval agencies, colleges participating in the platform.  </p><a class="link" href="Performance_Case Study7.html">Read More</a>

                                    <p class="margin-b-5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The client was migrating their distribution management platform from a legacy to a web based 3 tier platform, in order to meet the increased demand, and also to improve the efficiencies from the legacy system perspective. We understood the overall needs and expectations of the client, generated a huge amount of synthetic test data using excel macros and scripted & executed the performance test scenarios using the open source solution JMeter. As part of the analysis carried out post testing, we identified several issues with the indexing carried out, a couple of inefficient code snippets that were responsible for huge response time and also recommended the usage of Semaphore for synchronised invoice creation. Overall, this exercise helped in
reducing the response times, made the systems more efficient and also helped the customer in saving more than $150K.</p><a class="link" href="Performance_Case Study9.html">Read More</a>
